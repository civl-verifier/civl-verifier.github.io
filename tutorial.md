# Overview
- Civl is an extension of Boogie
- structure of Civl file (yielding procedures, atomic actions, yield invariants)


# Tackling noninterference

- location invariants, yield invariants, pre/post, loop invariants
- reduction
- linearity

# Refinement layers
- basic mechanics
- abstraction and reduction are symbiotic

# Tackling asynchony
- Summarizing asynchronous calls using pending asyncs
- Eliminating pending asyncs
